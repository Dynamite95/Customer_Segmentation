# Customer_Segmentation

This project is based on a research activity based on the paper "Maximizing Strategy Improvement in Mall Customer Segmentation
using K-means Clustering" by Musthofa Galih Pradana, Hoang Thi Ha ,in the year 2021.

Machine learning can investigate data sets of similar customers and interpret the most beneficial and most inadequate performing customer segments.
Following are the five steps to efficiently use machine learning to help us achieve results :


Step 1: Designing of a proper case before one starts

In this case research, we need to visualize consumer habits and styles from different perspectives. This involves asking basic questions like :
“Can the consumer support be organized into groups to generate customized connections within them?“ “Is determining the most vital customer gatherings within the entire pool of consumers worthy? “ To fully analyze the customers’ spending and regulation, we can practice with the latter points in
mind:
• Amount of commodities 
• ordered ordinary
• return rate
• cumulative spending


Step 2: Collect and prepare the data

The next step is to assemble the data to discover more different patterns and biases inside the datasets.We will also necessitate setting complex characteristics depending on the most relevant metrics for your organization.
It may involve:
• Medium lifetime value
• Consumer purchase cost
• Consumer pleasure
• Maintenance rate
• Net earnings
We will need to scale, pre-process and fill the missing values using the open-source tools available in python, such as pandas, NumPy, etc. This step needs to be fixed because they add to the visualization step later.The more extra customer data you have, the more precise decision you will perform in customer segmentation with machine learning.


Step 3: Performing Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is a famous method of unsupervised machine learning. This method obtains all of the diverse “clusters” and clubs them collectively while 
maintaining them as tiny as attainable. The Algorithm works in the following manner:
First, we randomly initialize the value of k as the number of clusters or n- centroids.
Next, we allot each data point to the nearest centroid forming separate groups while
relocating the center to the middle of all clusters employing Euclidean distance.
While working through the preceding steps, the algorithm checks and tries to reduce
the sum of squared distances among clustered-point and middle for all clusters.
When all data points unite, repetition ends.


Step 4: Tuning the Optimal Hyperparameters for the model

Determining the most beneficial kit of hyperparameters for an algorithm is the subsequent measure in customer segments with Machine Learning because it assists us in attaining the most genuine and satisfying customer crowds. While choosing the k value, we will select upon the optimization principles of the K-means.


Step 5: Visualization of the results
At last, we visualize the decisions applying the plotting library in python for making interactive graphs, plots, and charts. Then we understand the charts and various graphs to develop our enterprise.Possessing genuine consumer profiles at your fingertips will help enhance marketing operations targeting, innovation launches, and the merchandise roadmap.It will provide your organization exceptionally more evident thoughts about which customers have the most effective retention rate, contracts, and additional metrics you initially planned
